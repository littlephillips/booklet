* This is a simple quiz web application called "Booklet".
*  It contains four cards, each with a question related to general knowledge. 
*  The questions are progressively displayed on separate cards, and users are required to answer each question before proceeding to the next one. 
*  The user's answer is checked after clicking the "Next" button. If the answer is correct, the user proceeds to the next question, but if it's incorrect, the user is prompted to try again. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* The HTML file contains the basic layout of the application, including the four cards, each with its header, body, and footer. 
* The header contains the title of the card, the body contains the question, input field for the user's answer, and the "Next" button. The footer contains the JavaScript file to handle the application's functionality.

* The CSS file defines the styling of the application, including the layout of the cards, header, body, and footer. 
* The CSS also defines the styles for the "Next" button.

* The JavaScript file contains the application's logic, including event listeners for the "Next" button, the switch statement to check the user's answer, and the code to toggle the active card. 
* It also contains code to store the user's answer and to display an alert if the answer is incorrect.
